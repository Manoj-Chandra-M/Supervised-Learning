# Supervised-Learning
A classification problem is solved with two different sets of features and three different algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests
The input data is standardized and the hyper parameters are optimized so that the model could make better predictions.
The best model is chosen based on the performance metrics such as accuracy, precission, recall and F1 score.
